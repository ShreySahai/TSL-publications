An ejector is a passive device that pumps a secondary fluid by energy augmentation from a primary fluid. The performance of the ejector is primarily dependent on the complex gas dynamic interactions between the primary and secondary flows in a variable area duct. The maximum mass flow rate of the ejector in the critical flow regime is limited by choking of both the primary and secondary flows. This paper focuses on experimental investigations on the",

In the case of solar operated power plants, it is even more difficult due to varying heat source temperatures induced by variability in insolation levels. This paper introduces a quantitative methodology for load regulation of a CO 2 based Brayton cycle power plant using the 'thermal efficiency and specific work output'coordinate system. The analysis shows that a transcritical CO 2",

Subsequently, microstructure evolution is studied employing a phase field method. Simulations are performed to understand the effect",

The microstructure depended on several process parameters such as stirring intensity, stirring frequency, cooling rate, and melt initial superheat. Through a series of computational studies and controlled experiments, a set of process parameters were identified to produce the best microstructures. Reheating",
